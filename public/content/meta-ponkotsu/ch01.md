"――Hah, perfect. Don't you think, Pri-chan?"

While holding up the paper with the magic circle inscribed on it, I turned towards Pri-chan—a artificial fairy named Prineus. Despite the masculine name, the designated gender is female. We've been companions since my past life, and Pri-chan supports me with controlling nanomachines and various other things.

Pri-chan, being a light ball about the size of a ping pong ball, doesn't have a readable expression. Yet, is it just my imagination that I sense a somewhat exasperated gaze?

"…I never thought someone would seriously create a spell for interdimensional transfer deemed impossible. Truly, the master is a genius fool."

"Oh? Even though you're praising me, it feels like you're mocking me, huh?"

"With this spell, theoretically, transfer to Japan is possible. But I can't fathom the reason for transferring to Japan in the first place."

"Eh~? After all, King-sama, that old man, unilaterally decided to annul the engagement, and I got declared 'exiled'! So, there's no need to cling to this country anymore, right?"

"I understand leaving this country, but I don't see the point of risking failure for interdimensional transfer."

"Hehehe, maybe my passion is hard to understand."

"It's incomprehensible. Despite having talent in magic, succeeding as a sorcerer or alchemist, and having money, why would you want to return to the world of your past life (Japan)? Is there a possibility where magic is not satisfyingly usable in Japan?"

In this world, a mysterious substance called "magical essence" is present in the air, which is converted into magical power for spellcasting. Without it, one would have to rely on the limited magical power generated internally, inevitably restricting the use to small-scale magic.

In Japan, where magic didn't exist—on Earth, the possibility of magical essence being absent is high.

But still, I have to go back to Japan.

"I feel a strong determination from you. Is it for the sake of the family left behind? Or is there something unfinished?"

"Hehe, I'll tell only Pri-chan. You're my precious friend, after all."

"…"

Pri-chan swallowed audibly. I felt it. Although she looks like a light ball, I can't be sure.

"The reason I want to go back to Japan is..."

"And that is?"

"—I miss miso, soy sauce, and white rice!"

"…, …What?"

"Besides, there are no soybeans in this world. Even if I grow soybean-like plants and process them, it doesn't turn out well. The miso and soy sauce reproduced by other reincarnators are a bit different too! Also, I'm tired of bread every day! I want to eat white rice!"

"…Ah, I see."

There seems to be a mixture of disbelief in Pri-chan's emotions, but it must be my imagination. Because there's no way this passionate feeling for miso, soy sauce, and white rice can go unnoticed.

"Alright, now that I've got Pri-chan's approval, the spell should be fine. Let's try interdimensional transfer right away!"

Drawing a magic circle on the floor, I charged it with magical power—just before making the move, I stopped and turned my head towards Pri-chan.

"What about you, Pri-chan? Going back to Japan is my selfish wish, and if you want, you can stay—"

"What are you saying? We're 'friends,' right? I'll accompany you properly."

"Oh, Pri-chan, you're getting all affectionate."

"I'll hit you, you know?"

"Even though you're a ball of light, I wonder how you'd do that—no, let's not try. I might get my head cracked."

"What do you think of me?"

While avoiding Pri-chan's accusing gaze, I activated the magic circle. As my whole body was enveloped in a faint light—

(…Is this farewell to this world?)

Feeling sentimental, I casually glanced around. A worn-out bed, a bookshelf haphazardly stuffed with books, old and unused experimental equipment, and here and there, a burnt table...

In the periphery of my vision, I suddenly caught sight of dancing butterflies. Feathers were predominantly purple and black, with white and yellow patterns here and there—a beautiful butterfly, even though I didn't know its name, it felt strangely nostalgic.

(…Beautiful.)

The moment my consciousness was captivated by the butterflies, the magic circle exhibited its designated performance. I was about to transfer from this world to another world, Japan—

"...Ah, wait, I messed up."
