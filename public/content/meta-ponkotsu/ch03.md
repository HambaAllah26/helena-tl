"...Huh? Was Nobunaga bald?"

『Please refrain from making comments that might get your head chopped off if Nobunaga himself heard them.』

“Ah~, that’s right. I wouldn’t die, but I don’t want to get hurt.”

『Ordinary people would die if their heads were chopped off. Well, my master is someone who keeps challenging the concept of ‘ordinary’, so it’s a meaningless point.』

“I’ve been thinking for a while, but is Pri-chan trying to pick a fight with me?”

『Why would I pick a fight with my beloved master? You are the person I respect the most.』

“I’m happy to be evaluated by Pri-chan~ If it wasn’t a monotone, I’d be even happier.”

『I’m sorry. It seems I became monotone because I made a comment that wasn’t from the heart.』

"Harsh... Can I cry now?"

『Please feel free. I can’t offer a handkerchief in this form of a light sphere, so I’ll have to leave you be.』

“Even if it’s humanoid form, I have a strong feeling of being left alone…”

While Pri-chan and I were having our usual silly exchange, there was a buzz around us. It seems that the foot soldiers who had been walking up the mountain path were talking in hushed voices.

As our conversation paused, I tried to listen carefully, but for some reason, I couldn't understand the content. They were undoubtedly Japanese in appearance, and their clothing and equipment confirmed we were in Japan. Yet, I couldn't comprehend their conversation, even though I caught familiar words here and there. However, these snippets didn't form a coherent dialogue.

I also spoke to Pri-chan in a low voice.

“Pri-chan, Pri-chan. I can understand the language, but  at the same time I can’t understand it. What’s going on?”

『…The oldest voice recording of Japanese is said to be from the Paris Expo (1900). That Japanese can be understood by ‘modern people’, but it also had a unique pronunciation. If you go back about 350 years from there, it’s not strange that even the same Japanese people can’t understand the conversation. Especially in the Sengoku period, dialects were strong, and there is a theory that Ishida Mitsunari rejected the Shimazu’s night battle plan at the Battle of Sekigahara because he couldn’t understand the Satsuma dialect in the first place. However, Mitsunari was ‘guiding’ the Shimazu under the Toyotomi administration, and he was entertaining Shimazu Yoshihisa and Yoshihiro who came to Kyoto, so it’s not that the language didn’t communicate… Well, but there is a possibility that there was no interpreter at Sekigahara…』

“Oh, okay…”

This is Pri-chan's bad habit—the 'once she starts thinking, she can't stop' habit—had been triggered. I guess I won’t be able to get advice for a while.

So I decided to use the “Automatic Translation, Ratio”. As the name suggests, it’s a convenient magic that automatically translates for you.

"...Milord, could she be..."

A young man who was leading a horse by the reins asked a bald man - no, a rugged man on horseback.

The young man is better equipped than the other foot soldiers, so he might be a close servant of the man on horseback.

Without answering the young man's question, the horseman looked somewhat dazed and stared at me.

“…Is this what I think it is? A situation where they’re speechless at my beauty?”

『Please save your sleep talk for when you’re asleep. Well, my master was a peerless beauty in the original world, but the ‘beauty’ of the Sengoku period was considered to be having a melon face, and the problem in the first place is, aren’t they just surprised at the color of your eyes and hair?』

"Eyes and hair?"

I took out a hand mirror from the storage system (commonly known as an item box or storage) and checked my appearance.

Silver hair reaching my waist.

Ruby-like red eyes.

Not to mention, a distinctly foreign face.

"...Yeah, looks normal to me."

Silver hair and red eyes were rare even in my original world, but as someone who saw them every morning in the mirror, they were a familiar sight to me.

『If you think that appearance is normal, you might want to take out your eyeballs and wash them thoroughly.』

"Isn't Pri-chan too harsh on me?"

『That’s because you’re always spouting nonsense.』

While Pri-chan and I were exchanging this heartwarming master-servant friend conversation,  the man who had been riding the horse dismounted and approached me.

I had a feeling I could see a hint of madness in the depths of the man’s eyes.

The man stopped in front of me, unabashedly extended both hands, and touched my cheeks without any reservation. He continued to stroke my face and head as if confirming something. It was a bit embarrassing to have my bangs lifted and be stared at.

『…He’s rude. Shall we kill him?』

(P-Please don't say something so dangerous...)

It’s a relief that Pri-chan’s voice can’t be heard by others.

If I spoke out loud, it would look like I was talking to myself, so I communicate with her in thought.

(Well, in my original world, silver hair and red eyes were rare, and in the Sengoku period of Japan, it would be even more unusual, so let's forgive a bit of rudeness.)

『I don’t think he’s stroking you because silver hair and red eyes are rare…』

While I was talking to Pri-chan without speaking out loud, a man asked a question with a slight tremble in his voice.

“…Are you… Kichō?”

“Eh? Ah, yes. (Silver hair and red eyes are) valuable… right?”

"...I see, it must be true then. Could it be that Kicho, who went missing in childhood, is..."

The man muttered with a quivering voice, and his eyes were moist. Wait, did I say something weird?

『It seems that a major misunderstanding is progressing…』

Pri-chan’s voice was full of disbelief. For some reason, I felt like she was looking at the man in front of me.

『Kichō. Mino. The two-headed wave crest on the kimono… Considering the Western calendar and the apparent age, it is highly likely that he is Saitō Dōsan…』

(Eh? Dōsan?)

『Yes. It’s almost certain.』

(Isn’t it Nobunaga?)

『Are you still saying that…』

(Because it's a promise... Oh! If it's Dōsan , then it's Kicho! In other words, Nōhime, Nobunaga’s legal wife!)

『Why didn’t you realize it until now? Even though you’re a military otaku. If you see a two-headed wave crest on a shaved head, the first thing naturally to come in mind is him.』

(No, no, just because I’m a military otaku doesn’t mean I remember all the family crests, and besides, I’m not a document type, but an equipment type. I’m a military otaku who loves weapons, not people. There are various genres within military otaku, you know――)

『Ah, I don’t care about the explanation.』

(That’s mean!?)

『Even so, you should be able to understand a two-headed wave crest… Are you an equipment type? Then, do you know how to make a matchlock gun?』

(Huh? If it’s a matchlock gun, it’s the winding method, right? First, you forge a round iron rod called a true gold with a plate-shaped iron plate wrapped around it. If that’s all, it won’t withstand the firing, so you wrap around an iron rod in the shape of a plate and forge it. After pulling out and polishing the true gold, if you plug the gun tail with a screw, the gun barrel is complete. By the way, there are two methods of making screws that have been handed down――)

『How smoothly you talk. I’m beyond impressed and just amazed.』

(You asked me yourself!?)

While Pri-chan and I were having a (reality-escaping) silly exchange,

“――You guys! What are you up to!?”

A young man who seemed to be Dōsan’s side servant raised his tense voice.

When I looked in the direction of his gaze, the foot soldiers who were guarding us were keeping their distance and surrounding me and Dōsan, pointing the tips of their spears at us.

“Heh, we’re going to kill you guys here.”

The man who seemed to be the representative of the foot soldiers showed a vulgar smile.

The man I met for the first time (Dōsan?) still had his hand on my cheek. I, who was being pointed at by multiple spears.

No, no, what’s this development? How did it come to this?
